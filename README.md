### 2. MongoDB Atlas Setup

1. **Create MongoDB Atlas Account**
   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Create a new cluster (free tier M0)

2. **Database Setup**

4. **Network Access**
   - In Atlas, go to "Network Access"
   - Add IP Address: `0.0.0.0/0` (for Vercel deployment)
   - Or add your specific IP for local development

### 3. Environment Variables

1. **Create `.env.local` file** in the project root:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/
MONGODB_DB=quizapp
TEACHER_PASS=your_secure_teacher_password
STUDENT_PASS=your_secure_student_password
```

2. **Important**: Replace the default passwords with secure ones!

### 4. Local Development

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

## üß™ Testing

### Local Testing
1. Start the development server: `vercel dev`
2. Test teacher interface with password: `teacher123`
3. Add some sample questions
4. Test student interface with password: `student123`
5. Take the quiz and verify results

### Production Testing
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Test both interfaces with your custom passwords
3. Verify database operations work correctly
4. Test responsive design on different devices

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Unauthorized" Error
- Check environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
- Verify passwords match between frontend and backend
- Ensure MongoDB connection string is correct

#### Questions Not Loading
- Check MongoDB Atlas network access (allow 0.0.0.0/0)
- Verify database and collection names
- Check MongoDB Atlas connection limits

#### API Not Working
- Ensure `vercel.json` is configured correctly
- Check Vercel function logs in dashboard
- Verify API endpoints are deployed

#### Database Connection Issues
- Check MongoDB URI format
- Verify username/password in connection string
- Ensure cluster is running in Atlas

### Development Mode Fallback
The app includes localStorage fallback for development when backend APIs are not available:
- Uses sample questions for testing
- Stores results locally
- Perfect for frontend development
